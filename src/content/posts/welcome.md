Hello, friend! 

If you're reading this, that means you've somehow come across my personal site [megfh.dev](megfh.dev "megfh.dev") and I am _so_ glad that you're here! 

I built this site for a few different reasons: 

* I needed a new personal website where I could showcase my projects and writing 
* I'd been spending some time learning Gatsby and wanted to dig in deeper 
* I really wanted to try out Forestry CMS - they're Canadian, eh? ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
* I've been reading Shawn Wang's (aka [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx "swyx")) [Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/ "Coding Career Handbook"), and I intend for this site to be a place where I can **Learn in Public** and **Open Source \[my\] Knowledge.** I can't count the number of times I have been helped by others sharing their knowledge online, so I _hope_ I can pass on the favour! 

That's all for now! Please take a look around and reach out if you want to chat ðŸ˜Š
