description: This project uses python, the twitter api and the twilio api to acquire free pizza üçï

This is one of the first real side projects that I completed entirely for myself.
It's not pretty but it works, and I like to showcase it because I believe that it represents one of the core facets of being a developer - identifying a problem, and using code to solve it!

One of the local pizza shops in my hometown tweets every day a couple of names that can get free pizza! üçï (this is currently suspended due to COVID-19 but I really hope it comes back some day!)

**The problem:** if you aren't active on twitter or don't check every day, you might miss the chance for delicious free pizza! üòî

**The solution:** a script that will check the twitter feed of this local pizza shop, and send you a text if it's your name day for free pizza! üéâ
