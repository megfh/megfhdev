This project is my take on the 2021 [#100DaysOfGatsby Challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-challenge-1/).

In this challenge, you are the newest hire at the (fake) headphone sharing startup, AudioC0RE! The challenge was delivered in sprints, with various tasks being completed along the way.

### [Sprint 1: Proof of Concept](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-challenge-1)

- ✅ Build a proof of concept (POC) Gatsby site to test their routing API, builds service, hosting, and Contentful integration
- ✅ Use Gatsby’s Contentful plugin and connect to a test Contentful site
- ✅ Create the following pages:
  - home
  - about
  - and a collection of pages for every city we’re in.
- ✅ Build it on Gatsby Cloud and use their preview URL

### [Sprint 2: Launching the Website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/challenge-2)

- ✅ Use the Chakra UI component library as the basis for the site design
- ✅ Create a “contact” page, and add a form using Formium.
- ⏳ Choose a CDN to deploy the site to, and continue to measure Lighthouse scores as you add features.
- ✅ Add an image of headphones for the homepage, and a skyline image for each city page. Use Gatsby’s new gatsby-plugin-image project to optimize the images. Here’s the step-by-step guide.
- ⏳ Replace React with Preact using this plugin.
- ✅ Add Progressive Web App capabilities to the site, including making the site work offline.
- ✅ Follow Gatsby’s tutorial for optimizing the site for SEO.

### [Sprint 3: Add a WordPress-Powered Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-challenge-3)

- ✅ Add Gatsby’s new WordPress integration to the existing site.
- ✅ Have the default “post” content in the WordPress install power a new /blog route on AudioC0RE’s site
- ⏳ Add Yoast SEO and the WPGraphQL extension to WordPress, and use that data to power the metadata for blog posts.

### [Sprint 4: Add Shopfy ecommerce](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-challenge-4)

- ✅ The store should live under a new “/shop” route on the site
- ✅ Use the new BETA source integration plugin for Shopify that Gatsby launched at their conference, gatsby-source-shopify-experimental
- ⏳ Create a landing page, and pages for two products – a shirt and a hat

### [Sprint 5: Create a Gatsby Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-challenge-5)

- ⏳ Build a Gatsby theme to make scaling the AudioCORE website a consistent, rapid process.
- ⏳ When complete, publish your Theme to the npm (node package manager) library so others can use it!
