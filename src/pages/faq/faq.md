Hello friend üëã . Thanks for taking an interest in me and my profile.
Below are some answers to the types of questions usually covered in an initial interview.
Because I value my time and yours, please take the time to read through these before reaching out üôè

### Are you eligible to work in the US?

Not currently. I am a Canadian citizen and would need to aquire a work visa to work in US.

### What's your current situation?

I am currently employed full time as a software developer, but actively looking for my next opportunity üëÄ

### What's your ideal role?

- Working on a team of developers where the emphasis is on technical development.
- Working in Javascript across the stack (I have experience with React, Gatsby, NodeJS, and Express).
  - I have played around with other stacks before (Python, Ruby on Rails), and am confident in my ability to pick up new languages or frameworks, if needed
- Working on a team that values collaboration, asynchronous communication, thorough documentation, and fun!
- Permanent, full time, with benefits. No contract roles.

### What sort of company do you want to work with?

An organization that contributes to the community, values their employees, and invests in their learning and growth. Some questions to consider:

- How are we making a difference in our community & the world?
- How do we make our employees feel safe, valued, and excited about work?
- How are we investing in their learning and growth?
- Do we have a clear engineering career path, or a framework for how an employee might progress in the company?

### Are you willing to relocate?

Nope! I am only looking for remote roles at this time.

### Are you willing to work remotely?

Yes! I prefer to work remotely.
While COVID-19 forced a lot of companies into remote work, I would prefer to work for an organization that is **intentionally remote** and has setup their processes accordingly.

### Can I see your resume?

Sure, my resume is [here](https://www.notion.so/Meghan-Hannon-6cbdec06e5d9490984863664640a9545)

### Notice period?

Currently, three weeks.

### Interview availability?

I can telephone interview with little notice.

I can video call with prior arrangement.

I am not willing to go through multiple rounds of interviews without clear expectations regarding salary, vacation & benefits. I value my time and yours, so this should be covered in our initial discussion.
